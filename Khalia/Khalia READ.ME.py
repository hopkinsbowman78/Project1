To create the chart analyzing mental health conditions across different streaming services, I first imported the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot for visualization. I loaded the dataset from a CSV file and addressed missing values by filling in blank entries for the 'BPM' column and dropping any remaining rows with missing values. After cleaning the data, I selected relevant columns related to streaming services and mental health conditions, such as Depression, Insomnia, OCD, and Anxiety. I then grouped the data by the 'Primary streaming service' and calculated the mean scores for each mental health condition. Using matplotlib, I created bar plots for each condition, displaying mean scores by streaming service. The final visualizations were presented in a bar graph , with each plot highlighting the mean scores for Depression, Insomnia, OCD, and Anxiety across different streaming services. The analysis revealed trends in mental health outcomes associated with various streaming platforms, offering insights into potential correlations between service usage and mental well-being.
