# Project 1

For Project 1, I worked with a team to find and analyze a dataset of our choice. We chose to explore Mental Health in Tech. People working in tech are often at their desks for extended amounts of time. We explored  how this trend correlates with mental health. We examined the data collected through surveys and searched for trends. We wanted to find out if there is a link between mental health and companies that offer wellness programs. We examined such questions as: What do the results show you about the state of mental health in tech? Can you suggest steps that companies can take to help their employees?

## Synopsis of Process

2. Worked with my team to research current questions/problems in the Data Analystics Field and to find possible data sources to address the problem.
2. Brainstormed possible structures needed to accomplish the goals of the challenge.
3. Looked back at Bootcamp class activites to find code to accomplish processes.
4. Researched the resources listed below to find additional, or more elegant, code.
5. Cleaned and tested scripts.
6. Used observations to create an analysis. 
7. Posed more questions for further research.
