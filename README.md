# Project 1

For Project 1, our team was required to find and analyze a dataset of our choice. We chose to explore Mental Health and Music. 

## Context

Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.

However, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.

The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. 

Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind.


## Synopsis of Process

To tackle this challenge we...

1. Read and decoded the requirements of the project.
2. Worked with my team to research current questions/problems in the Data Analystics Field and to find possible data sources to address the problem.
2. Brainstormed possible structures needed to accomplish the goals of the challenge.
3. Looked back at Bootcamp class activites to find code to accomplish processes.
4. Researched the resources listed below to find additional, or more elegant, code.
5. Cleaned, merged and tested scripts.
6. Used observations to create an analysis.
7. Outlined and created presentation.
