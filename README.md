# Project 1

For Project 1, our team was required to find and analyze a dataset of our choice. We chose to explore Mental Health and Music. 

## Context

Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.

However, MT employs a wide range of different genres, varying from one organization to the next.

The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. 

Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind.


## Synopsis of Process

To tackle this challenge we...

1. Read and decoded the requirements of the project.
2. Researched current questions/problems in the Data Analystics Field and to find possible data sources to address the problem.
3. Brainstormed possible structures needed to accomplish the goals of the challenge.
4. Looked back at Bootcamp class activites to find code to accomplish processes.
5. Researched the resources listed below to find additional, or more elegant, code.
6. Cleaned, merged and tested scripts.
7. Used observations to create an analysis.
8. Outlined and created presentation.



## Analysis

The analysis of the MxMH dataset uncovers specific correlations between music preferences, streaming habits, and mental health conditions, offering targeted insights for music therapy. 

Notably, users of Pandora report lower levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and OCD compared to those using Spotify and Apple Music, where higher levels of anxiety and depression are prevalent. 

Additionally, genres like Jazz and Classical are associated with lower OCD and insomnia scores, while genres such as Lofi and EDM are linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression. 

Even though there are some positive correlations, the r-squared values are so low that we conclude that there is no significant relationship between the hours spent on music per day and the level of the four types of mental health issues.

These findings emphasize the importance of personalized music therapy that takes into account the type of music, streaming service, and listening habits, enabling more effective treatments and innovative approaches within the music therapy industry.
