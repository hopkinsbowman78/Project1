# Project 1

For Project 1, our team was required to find and analyze a dataset of our choice. We chose to explore Mental Health and Music. 

## Context

Music therapy (MT) involves using music to enhance an individual’s stress levels, mood, and overall mental well-being. It is an evidence-based practice known for stimulating the release of "happy" hormones like oxytocin.

MT utilizes a diverse array of music genres, with the specific approach varying across different organizations.

The MxMH dataset is designed to explore potential correlations between a person’s music preferences and their self-reported mental health. 736 respondents answered questions focused on musical preferences, listening habits and mental health.

Ultimately, the goal is to either refine the application of MT or offer intriguing insights into the relationship between music and mental health.



## Final Analysis: The Impact of Music on Mental Health and Implications for Music Therapy

The MxMH dataset explores the relationship between music preferences, streaming habits, and self-reported mental health conditions such as Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, and OCD. The findings from the data can contribute to the understanding of how music affects mental health and the potential application of Music Therapy (MT).


### 1. Streaming Service Usage and Mental Health
![Streaming Data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c38edc2-c149-45df-b4b3-16616a93bd3d)

+ Different streaming services are associated with varying levels of mental health conditions.
+ Pandora users generally report lower levels of Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, and OCD, suggesting a potentially less negative or more positive impact of this service on mental health.
+ Spotify and Apple Music users report higher levels of these conditions, which could indicate that the content or usage patterns associated with these services are linked to higher mental health symptoms.

**Implication:** The differences between streaming services could be related to user demographics, the type of music content provided, or the specific ways in which people engage with these platforms. This insight is valuable for MT practitioners when recommending music platforms or content.




 ## Synopsis of Process

To tackle this challenge we...

1. Read and decoded the requirements of the project.
2. Researched current questions/problems in the Data Analystics Field and to find possible data sources to address the problem.
3. Brainstormed possible structures needed to accomplish the goals of the challenge.
4. Looked back at Bootcamp class activites to find code to accomplish processes.
5. Researched the resources listed below to find additional, or more elegant, code.
6. Cleaned, merged and tested scripts.
7. Used observations to create an analysis.
8. Outlined and created presentation.
9. Wrote final analysis.
