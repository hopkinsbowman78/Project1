# Project 1

For Project 1, our team was required to find and analyze a dataset of our choice. We chose to explore Mental Health and Music. 

## Context

Music therapy (MT) involves using music to enhance an individual’s stress levels, mood, and overall mental well-being. It is an evidence-based practice known for stimulating the release of "happy" hormones like oxytocin.

MT utilizes a diverse array of music genres, with the specific approach varying across different organizations.

The MxMH dataset is designed to explore potential correlations between a person’s music preferences and their self-reported mental health. 736 respondents answered questions focused on musical preferences, listening habits and mental health.

Ultimately, the goal is to either refine the application of MT or offer intriguing insights into the relationship between music and mental health.



## Final Analysis: The Impact of Music on Mental Health and Implications for Music Therapy

The MxMH dataset explores the relationship between music preferences, streaming habits, and self-reported mental health conditions such as Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, and OCD. The findings from the data can contribute to the understanding of how music affects mental health and the potential application of Music Therapy (MT).

### 1. Streaming Service Usage and Mental Health
**Question:** Is there a correlation between the primary streaming service used and mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD)?

**Analysis:** Compare mental health scores across different streaming services (e.g., Spotify, Pandora, YouTube Music).

+ Different streaming services are associated with varying levels of mental health conditions.
+ Pandora users generally report lower levels of Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, and OCD, suggesting a potentially less negative or more positive impact of this service on mental health.
+ Spotify and Apple Music users report higher levels of these conditions, which could indicate that the content or usage patterns associated with these services are linked to higher mental health symptoms.

**Implication:** The differences between streaming services could be related to user demographics, the type of music content provided, or the specific ways in which people engage with these platforms. This insight is valuable for MT practitioners when recommending music platforms or content.

###  2. Favorite Genre and Mental Health
**Question:** Does the favorite genre of music have an impact on mental health conditions?

**Analysis:** Compare mental health scores for different favorite genres.

+ The genre of music listened to also shows correlations with mental health outcomes.
+ Lofi, Classical, and EDM are associated with higher levels of Anxiety and Depression.
+ Jazz, Classical, and Gospel tend to correlate with lower levels of OCD and Insomnia.

**Implication:** Certain genres might exacerbate or alleviate mental health conditions. MT practitioners could leverage these insights to tailor music therapy interventions more effectively. For instance, avoiding certain genres or emphasizing others could potentially improve mental health outcomes.

### 3. Music Effects on Mental Health Conditions
**Question:** What are the self-reported effects of music on various mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, insomnia, OCD)?

**Analysis:** Analyze the 'Music effects' column in relation to mental health scores.

+ The dataset reveals diverse effects of music on individuals with varying levels of Depression, Anxiety, Insomnia, and OCD.
+ A significant number of individuals report that music improves their condition, particularly for Anxiety and Depression. However, a notable portion also reports no effect or even a worsening of symptoms.


**Implication:** Music therapy should be personalized, as the effects of music on mental health are not uniform. While some individuals might find music therapeutic, others might experience no benefit or even a deterioration in their condition. Understanding a patient’s specific reactions to music is crucial for effective MT interventions.

### 4. Hours Spent on Music and Mental Health
**Question:** How does the number of hours spent listening to music per day affect mental health?

**Analysis:** Analyze the relationship between hours per day and mental health scores.

+ The data indicates a varying relationship between the number of hours spent listening to music and different mental health conditions.
+ Anxiety and Depression: There is a slight positive correlation between hours spent listening to music and higher levels of anxiety and depression. This could suggest that individuals with higher anxiety and depression may use music as a coping mechanism, though it might not always alleviate their symptoms.
+ Insomnia: A similar trend is observed for insomnia, where increased hours of music listening correlate with higher insomnia levels.
+ OCD: The relationship between music listening hours and OCD is also positively correlated, though slightly less pronounced than with other conditions.

**Implication:** While music is often used as a coping tool, the data suggests that simply listening to music more may not reduce symptoms of mental health conditions and might be associated with higher symptom levels. This underscores the importance of understanding the type and context of music being consumed.
